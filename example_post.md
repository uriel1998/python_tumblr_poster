My Amazing Blog Post Title
#technology #programming #python #tumblr

This is the main description of my blog post. It can contain **markdown formatting** like bold text, *italic text*, and even code snippets.

Here's some more content that explains what this post is about. You can write multiple paragraphs and the script will handle them properly.

<img src="https://example.com/my-image.jpg" alt="A descriptive alt text for accessibility">

You can also include links in your content like this: [Check out this awesome resource](https://example.com/resource)

The script will automatically parse:
- The first line as the title
- The second line as hashtags (with or without # symbols)
- Everything else as the post body content
- Any images with their alt text
- Any markdown links

Multiple links are supported: [Another link](https://another-example.com) and [Yet another](https://third-example.com)
